* System
** DONE Generalize combat rules for websocket [1/1]
*** Notes
 Need a messaging system to allow for waiting for message passing between hosts for Dodge rolls/Spending Fate chips etc.
 A full Combat action has the following phases:

 | # | Action                       | Melee | Ranged | Potential Actions                                             |

*** DONE Functions [3/3]
**** DONE Request Dodge
Needs to ping a player and get a response before proceeding with dice rolls.
**** DONE Calculate Range
**** DONE Allow spending fate chips on misses.
Need to have a dialog open up when a player misses and/or critical fails.
*** Resolution
 Updated combat automation to be websocket based which allows for dialog boxes for various combat events.
 Armour is now calculated and the die type lowered before any damage rolls are made.
 Marshal's when targeting a player and firing with a weapon from an NPC if the player has action cards left then they will receive a dodge dialog asking if they would like to discard their highest card to dodge.
